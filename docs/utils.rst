Miscellaneous utilities

Time intervals with units
=========================

Time is measured in seconds, but edzed classes accept also
time periods written as strings with other usual time units, e.g.:

  | ``'2m'`` = 2 minutes = 120.0 seconds
  | ``'20h15m10'`` = 20 hours + 15 minutes + 10 seconds = 72910.0
  | ``'2d 12h'`` = 2 days + 12 hours = 216000.0

Format:
  TIMESTRING = [DAYS]Â [HOURS] [MINUTES] [SECONDS]

  where:
    - DAYS = <int> "D"
    - HOURS = <int> "H"
    - MINUTES = <int> "M"
    - SECONDS =  <int or float> ["S"]

Notes:
  - whitespace around numbers and units is allowed
  - numbers do not have to be normalized, e.g. ``'72h'`` is fine
  - unit symbols ``D``, ``H``, ``M``, ``S`` may be entered in upper or lower case
  - negative values are not allowed
  - float values with exponents are not supported

Conversions routines:

.. function:: timestr(seconds: Union[int, float]) -> str

  Convert seconds, return a string with time units.

  Minutes (``m``) and seconds (``s``) are always present in the result.
  Days (``d``) and hours (``h``) are prepended only when needed.

  Partial seconds are formatted to 3 decimal places.

.. function:: convert(timestring: str) -> float

  Convert a string to number of seconds. See also the next function.

.. function:: time_period(period: Union[None, int, float, str]) -> Optional[float]

  This is a convenience function accepting all time period formats used in ``edzed``:

  - ``time_period(None)`` returns ``None``.

  - ``time_period(number)`` returns the number as :class:`float`. Negative values are converted to ``0.0``.

  - ``time_period(string)`` converts the string with :func:`convert`.



Clock and calendar related constants
====================================

.. data:: SEC_PER_DAY
          SEC_PER_HOUR
          SEC_PER_MIN

    Seconds per day, hour, minute (integers).

.. data:: MONTH_NAMES

    English names for months 1 to 12, e.g. ``MONTH_NAMES[3]`` is ``"March"``.


Improved asyncio.shield
=======================

Use :func:`shield_cancel` to protect small critical
task sections from immediate cancellation.

.. function:: shield_cancel(aw: Awaitable) -> Any
  :async:

  Shield from cancellation while *aw* is awaited.

  Any pending :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` is raised when *aw* is finished.

  Make the shielded code and its execution time as short as possible.

  .. warning:: Never suppress task cancellation completely!


Name to block resolver
======================

When referencing a circuit block, ``edzed`` generally allows to use
either a block name or a block object.

At some point the names need to be resolved, because the software works
only with objects internally. The resolver is a service provided by the
:doc:`circuit simulator<simulation>`.

.. method:: Circuit.resolve_name(obj, attr: str, block_type=edzed.Block)

  Register an object with the resolver.

  The object *obj* should be storing a reference to a circuit block
  in its attribute named *attr*.

  - If the reference is a name (i.e. a string), register the object
    to be processed by the resolver. The resolver will then replace the
    name by the corresponding block object and check its type
    before the simulation starts.

  - If the reference is a block object already, name resolving
    is not needed. Just check the type and return.

  The *block_type* is the required type of the referenced block.
  A :exc:`TypeError` is raised if the block is not an instance of this type.

Inverted output
---------------

The name to block resolver supports the ``'_not_NAME'`` notation, where the name
is derived from another block's NAME by prepending a ``'_not_'`` prefix.
The original NAME must not begin with an underscore.

This is a shortcut for connecting a logically inverted output. A new
:class:`Invert` block will be created automatically if it does not
exist already::

  edzed.Invert('_not_NAME').connect(NAME)
