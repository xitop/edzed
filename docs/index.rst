Welcome to edzed's documentation. The intended audience are Python developers.
Edzed is an asyncio based Python library for building small automated systems, i.e. systems
that control outputs according to input values, systemâ€™s internal state, date and time.
It is free and open-source.

The package contains:

- classes for creating combinational and sequential blocks
- methods for building a circuit by connecting the blocks
- a simple event-driven zero-delay digital circuit simulator
